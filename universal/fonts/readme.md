# Fonts
This is where all required fonts sit. The fonts have a prefix that shows what game it is for. Universal means that all or most of RobTop's games use this font.
Notes:
* Geometry Dash fonts from the editor are not included.
* The fonts labeled Geometry Dash are used in the assets themselves.
